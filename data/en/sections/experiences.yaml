        responsibilities:
          - Built and modified cutting edge machine learning tools using Python, SKlearn and TensorFlow for the prediction of chemical properties of proteins.
          - Modified source code of existing Molecular Dynamics (Fortran) framework DL POLY to handle free energy analysis from repulsive potentials.
          - Automated the preparation of input chemical structures and statistical analysis of time series data in Bash and Python.
          - Scaled deployment on clusters running over 10000 core hours per day, producing gigabyte scale trajectory data.
          - Maintained large Fortran codebase Environ, implemented new models to facilitate material discovery, cutting model training work down by 60%.
          - Developed automation and database software (AiiDA plugin) in Python, reducing time spent running and sharing simulations. New researchers can expand on existing work without preparation times usually ranging from 20-200 hours.
          - Managed small team of students to expand software capabilities. Adopted agile methodology, kanban boards, weekly one on one meetings with 4 other team members, mentoring, troubleshooting assistance.
          - Managed server operations on a Linux machine for a group of 10 researchers, handling gigabytes of data with redundancy.
          - Participated in hackathons dedicated to merging codebases, using Python to provide shared interfaces between highly parallelized C and Fortran codes. Developed [qepy](https://gitlab.com/shaoxc/qepy), a python wrapper to Quantum ESPRESSO, the worlds largest open source materials modeling suite.
