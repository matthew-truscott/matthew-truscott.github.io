Trampolines are a great way to see the use of such equations in the real world. First let\u0026rsquo;s ignore how they work and consider what they do. A trampoline is a large area of fabric that remains stretched out. When someone stands on the surface, the fabric gets pulled in, so that their feet are lower than the surface was originally. When someone jumps on the trampoline, the surface pushes back and allows them to jumps higher. Without any extra legwork, a person may remain bouncing for a little while, however, normally they\u0026rsquo;ll need to put in some effort in order to continue bouncing. How is this all possible?\nThe basic physics explanation is neat and simple. Trampolines exploit the nature of springs. Springs have some natural length, change this, and they supply a restoring force proportional to the length of contraction of expansion. Multiple springs are used, not only to fit the shape of the trampoline, but also so that each spring need not be as strong. Each spring has some tolerance, supply too much force (extend it too much) and they lose their ability to pull back. If you use springs together in parallel, the force each experiences, assuming the springs are identical, is split evenly. Let\u0026rsquo;s first consider a trampoline without a person standing on it. We will assume that one spring is in operation, (which is okay as long as they are identical), and that the fabric weighs nothing.\nConstructing the equation is straightforward, if force is proportional to extension, $$F=-kx$$ where k is a constant. Note the negative sign to denote a restoring force. As we have seen before, \\(F = ma\\) and \\(a\\) is just a second derivative of \\(x\\), so\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\\frac{k}{m}x$$\nSecond Order Differential Equations Let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and solve this, the result will be a relation between spring extension and time. Since spring extension is proportional to the height of the trampoline, the result will also describe this height. Second order differential equations are not easy to solve. The trick is to put them into a familiar form and then perform \u0026lsquo;standard techniques\u0026rsquo; on the result. First group all instances of x onto one side. If anything else exists, the equation is inhomogeneous and requires extra work. We\u0026rsquo;ll come back to that. If the right hand side is zero, the equation is homogenous. I will start with an intuitive way to solve the problem. Take a step back and consider the equation as is was first constructed. It is clear that the second derivative of x is proportional to x. Therefore it seems reasonable to want to find some function, that differentiates twice to give itself, multiplied by some factor. What functions do this?\nThe correct answer is of course an oscillating function typically described by a linear combination of sine and cosine functions. Take sine:\n$$\\frac{d\\sin(\\alpha t)}{dt} = \\alpha\\cos(\\alpha t)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2\\sin(\\alpha t)}{dt^2} = -\\alpha^2\\sin(\\alpha t)$$\nClearly in our case,\n$$\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$$\nso\n$$x = A\\sin(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}t + \\phi)$$\nI also added constants \\(\\phi\\) and \\(A\\) since these do not create any extra terms during differentiation.\nThe above gives the shape of such a curve. What values the constants end up taking depend on the initial conditions. In order to solve for three unknowns \\(A\\), \\(\\phi\\) and \\(t\\), we need three pieces of information. At some given it is necessary to know both the position and the velocity of the system (or the position at one time and the velocity at another time). The velocity is simply the derivative of the position. Clearly if the velocity and the position are zero at any time, the only possible configuration is \\(A = 0\\) and the trampoline never moves! But otherwise it takes a shape like in the graph.\nDamping Of course in reality the trampoline never continues to wobble ad infinitum, so we need to modify our model somewhat in order to get a more accurate representation. Like with last time, there is some opposing force involved which takes energy from the system, this one we usually call friction. I will not go into the math just yet. Let\u0026rsquo;s return to the simple trampoline again. Mathematically, how do you solve differential equations of this form? This applies to any order, but typically we use it for second-order equations because higher-orders get nasty. Say you have an equation of the form\n$$a\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + b\\frac{dy}{dx} + cy = 0$$\nwhere all the derivative terms are linear (you can extend this for higher powers no problem), the form that \\(y\\) takes is surprisingly simple. If all the terms are indeed linear, y has to look like an exponential of some kind. The derivatives of exponentials are all proportional in some way, so when you substitute them in to the differential equation, the exponent part simply cancels and you\u0026rsquo;re left with a polynomial! Second-order linear differential equations are clearly nice because they reduce to quadratic equations which are easy to solve. So let\u0026rsquo;s suppose \\(y = K\\exp mx\\) where \\(K\\) and \\(m\\) are constants. Plugging this into the differential equation gives\n$$Kam^2\\exp(mx) + Kbm\\exp(mx) + Kc\\exp(mx) = 0$$\nthe exponent part indeed cancels, along with the constant and we are left with\n$$am^2 + bm + c$$\nSince we want to find m, put this into the quadratic equation.\n$$m = \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s worth considering what different values m could take. Hopefully you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with the possible outputs from the quadratic equation. Note that we do consider the possibility of complex roots. Therefore there are three different types of solutions. Two real roots imply that there are two possible solutions to the differential equation, call these \\(A\\exp(m_+x)\\) and \\(A\\exp(m_-x)\\). One can combine these by the principle of superposition (if there are multiple solutions, then a linear combination of them must also be a solution). So the general solution would be written something like\n$$A\\exp(m_+x) + B\\exp(m_-x)$$\nIf there is only one root (that is, they are repeated), we find another solution by adding a linear component (I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s very important to understand why this is the case, just know that if this linear component causes a conflict, use a quadratic component and so on\u0026hellip;), it\u0026rsquo;s possible to write a general solution\n$$(A + Bx)\\exp(mx)$$\nIf the roots are complex, separate each into real and imaginary parts. Clearly they will share the same real part, and the solutions are\n$$A\\exp(nx)\\exp i(c_+x)$$\nand\n$$A\\exp(nx)\\exp i(c_-x)$$\nwhere \\(c_\\pm\\) are the imaginary components to \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) is the real part. Combine these using superposition to obtain\n$$\\exp(nx)(A\\exp i(c_+x) + B\\exp i(c_-x))$$\nNow\n$$\\exp i(x) = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)$$\nand we only want the real part (but \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be complex!), so we replace the imaginary exponents with trig terms and merge the constants. The imaginary part of the constants means it\u0026rsquo;s possible to have $$\\sin$$ terms, so we end up with\n$$\\lambda_1\\exp(nx)\\cos(cx) + \\lambda_2\\exp(nx)\\sin(cx)$$\nNow to explain the physical meaning of these. In the case of real roots, we have an exponential decay (draw it!) This is known as overdamping. The rate of decay is dependent on the constants. For repeated roots, we also have exponential decay, but it\u0026rsquo;s faster than overdamping. Now these situations occur with large damping. So imagine yourself on a rusty old trampoline not getting any bounce at all. The third case, with the complex roots, is known as underdamping, and now we get our nice oscillations, along with an exponential decay. This is like a more realistic version of our example beforehand, but eventually you\u0026rsquo;ll stop moving.\nForces and Resonance How are we able to keep bouncing? Well it turns out that by jumping, we exert a force on the trampoline that counteracts the energy lost by friction. This is known as forced oscillation. There is some driving force function acting on the oscillator. Now working through the math is long but gives interesting results. I\u0026rsquo;ll explore this in another post. For trampolines the driving force is rather complicated to model (it\u0026rsquo;s easier with swings).\n","date":"October 10, 2016","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"http://example.org/posts/ode-2/","summary":"There is a form of differential equation I never went into last time, I will generate it again, this time through a different stand-alone example.

As a result, we can make certain assumptions when thinking about people falling through the sky. Firstly, they fall directly towards the surface in more or less a straight line. Secondly, the time it takes to fall a certain distance is the same regardless of how heavy a person is. Physicists like to write mathematical relations to describe these observations. In the case of a falling entity we have\n$$t\\propto\\sqrt{d}$$\nwhere \\(d\\) is the height at which we start timing the fall, and \\(t\\) is the time that it takes to hit the ground. The relation was derived by noticing that every time the distance was increased by say a factor of four, the time taken to hit the ground would double, hence the square root relationship. One can rearrange and find the distance travelled as a function of time.\n$$d(t)=ct^2$$\nwhere c is some constant. Since velocity is the change of displacement with respect to time, and acceleration is the change of velocity, one can deduce that the speed of a falling object is proportional to the time from whence it was dropped, and the acceleration does not change at all (by the rules of differentiation).\nThis is significant because objects according to this model, don\u0026rsquo;t slow down! So falling is definitely fatal, if you start high enough. Of course, we know that height is not the only thing that determines your survival, or parachutes would not work. So what is wrong with the model? Now in physics, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that we don\u0026rsquo;t know how to simulate anything exactly, we make models that closely resemble the truth (the goal being that one day, our model of the universe will be 100% accurate). Today, I\u0026rsquo;ll stick to Newtonian physics which is a simplification of the model we currently have, and most of the time, works very well. Newton\u0026rsquo;s laws include a force acceleration relationship which is incredibly important for most of the physical calculations we will ever encounter. Simply put, force is proportional to acceleration, so double the force, double the acceleration. So all we need to do is know what forces are acting on an object, and we know how it moves around.\nGravitational Force This is great because now we know that there is in fact a constant force that acts on a falling body, despite our inability to see it. For now, we can think of some global gravitational force that pulls everything on the Earth to its surface. Up until now I have kept the constants unknown but I will replace these with known attributes so that it\u0026rsquo;s easier to see what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\n$$F = ma = mg$$\nwhere \\(F\\) is the force, \\(m\\) is the mass of an object and \\(g\\) is the constant acceleration when falling. Now let\u0026rsquo;s work backwards. What if we know this relation \\(F = mg\\) and we want to know where something is at a particular time? This isn\u0026rsquo;t as easy. First we write a relation between displacement and something we do know,\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = a = g$$\nwhere \\(x\\) is displacement. This is known as a differential equation. Alternatively, one can try and find the velocity at some given time, so that the differential equation takes the form\n$$\\frac{dv}{dt} = g$$\nI will start with this equation and come back to the other one later.\nFirst Order Ordinary Differential Equations The above equation is a first-order differential equation (read to the end for more details about this). It is separable, which means you can integrate both sides of the equation and solve each side independently. We end up with two integrals\n$$\\int dv = \\int gdt$$\nwhich is trivial to solve (assuming you know basic calculus),\n$$v = gt + c$$\nwhere the c is a constant. Note that each integral will generate a different constant but we can combine the two. We see the speed increases indefinitely with time.\nIntroducing Drag Now what if there was a force opposing a falling object? Would the speed carry on increasing to infinity, or will we reach a limit? Clearly if we just add a constant force, the equation becomes\n$$\\frac{dv}{dt} = g - b$$\nand since \\(g\\) and \\(b\\) are constants, they can be combined and we have effectively the same scenario (assuming \\(b\\) was less than \\(g\\)). What if this drag force \\(b\\) was proportional to the velocity? As the object got faster, the opposing force would increase. Once the force equalled the force pulling the object down, the net force would be zero and there would be no change in velocity! This seems to be what a parachute does, it limits the velocity of a falling object thus preventing death.\nThis new scenario is a non-separable equation. We have\n$$\\frac{dv}{dt} + b(t)v = g$$\nHow can we solve this? Clearly this is non-trivial, unless we have some mathematical insight into what is going on. Unfortunately, this is one of those cases where it is incredibly difficult to see what is happening unless you already know how to solve such an equation. However, I will try to be more thorough than most textbooks that simply assume the answer. In practice when solving such problems, it is not necessary to be so rigorous.\nThe general idea is to use the product rule. For functions of \\(t\\), \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), it is known that\n$$x\\frac{dy}{dt} + y\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(xy)$$\nNow suppose it is possible to convert the differential equation we intend to solve into this equation given by the product rule. The left hand side of our equation already has a \\(v\\) and a \\(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\) term, so we just need to determine the other function. However as the equation is at the moment, nothing fits. So we multiply both sides of our differential equation by some third function of \\(t\\), call \\(\\mu(t)\\). Now\n$$\\mu\\frac{dv}{dt} + b\\mu v = \\mu g$$\nwhere \\(v\\) and \\(\\mu\\) are functions to be entered into the product rule. We can match these terms up. The first term above matches the first term in the equation for the product rule (with some relabeling). If we match the second terms, we see that the derivative of \\(\\mu\\) with respect to \\(t\\) is simply \\(b\\mu\\). From the last terms, we see that the derivative of \\(v\\mu\\) with respect to \\(t\\) is \\(g\\mu\\). First we solve for \\(\\mu\\) and then once we have it, solving for \\(v\\) becomes a lot easier.\nSeparable Differential Equations The equation for \\(\\mu\\) is a separable differential equation, this is the case for any equation of the type\n$$y\\prime+A(x)y = f(x)$$\nour equation is just an example of this generalization. So we have\n$$\\frac{d\\mu}{dt} - b\\mu = 0$$\nwhich on division by \\(\\mu\\) followed by integration by \\(t\\), becomes\n$$\\int\\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu} - \\int b(t)dt$$\nwhich can be solved to get\n$$\\ln\\mu = \\int b(t)dt + c$$\nwhere \\(c\\) is the constant of integration. Hence\n$$\\mu = A\\exp(\\int b(t)dt)$$\nwhere \\(A\\) is a constant equal to the \\(\\exp c\\). Now that we know \\(\\mu\\), we solve for \\(v\\),\n$$\\frac{d(v\\mu)}{dt} = g\\mu$$\n$$v\\mu + c = \\int g\\mu dt$$\n$$v\\mu = Agb\\exp(bt) - c$$\n$$v = \\frac{g}{b} + c\\exp(-bt)$$\nTo solve for the constant, we need some boundary or initial condition. Here it makes most sense to assume that at \\(t = 0\\), the speed is zero. Once we solve the constant, we get\n$$v = \\frac{g}{b}(1 - \\exp(-bt))$$\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out how to do graphs yet, but you\u0026rsquo;ll get something that looks like an increase in velocity with increase in time, only there\u0026rsquo;s a limit in the velocity! The velocity increase slows down and never actually reaches a certain point. This \u0026lsquo;terminal velocity\u0026rsquo; can be calculated and it turns out it can be written \\(g/b\\). So if \\(b\\) is large enough, the limit in the falling speed can be made low enough so as not to permanently damage the object.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a step back and consider the problem from a non-mathematical perspective, how do parachutes do what they do? Well, one simplified way to think about it is to consider simply what air does. Back when scientist first formulated the rules governing falling bodies, they did so under the assumption that they were in a vacuum. That is, the reason acceleration can be slowed down is because we are not in a vacuum, it is the prescence of air that changes everything. But we can\u0026rsquo;t see air, how do we know it exists? This is actually a big question to consider, in physics, we should not really assume the existence of anything. Fortunately with the aid of machines, we can verify the existence of air, but without them we must rely on observing it indirectly; how it affects the world around us. Air is everywhere and it pushes back on objects moving around. In the case of falling objects, air pushes back at them, it pushes up. The faster something is moving against air, the stronger this pushing force. You may hear the term pressure used to describe this kind of effect. In the case of the parachute, the air under the parachutes pushes upwards against the direction of motion, the result being an upward force which is proportional to the speed of the parachute, and the surface area.\nExtending on the Drag Equation There are more representative drag force equations, but they\u0026rsquo;re quite difficult to derive. I\u0026rsquo;ll just state the result and maybe come back to it one day. I got this from the NASA website,\n$$F_d = \\frac{k\\rho v^2 A}{2}$$\nwhere A is the surface area, and $$\\rho$$ is the density of the air. I\u0026rsquo;ll assume we have no control over these and we just want to look at the change in speed over time, so I\u0026rsquo;ll write this as $$bv^2$$. The new differential equation which more accurately describes parachutes is\n$$\\frac{dv}{dt} + bv^2 = g$$\nThe result should be similar to beforehand, there should be a terminal velocity and the object never decelerates. I won\u0026rsquo;t go into this because unless the drag b is constant, the equation is somewhat more tricky to handle (I think? I might come back to this). Hopefully you can see what the result of the differential equation should look like after thinking about how it\u0026rsquo;s essentially the same as the case I described beforehand.\nNow drag is never straightforward. So let\u0026rsquo;s consider a particularly ugly looking scenario where the drag is approximated by a polynomial. I will ignore effects of gravity since this creates another ugly level of complexity. Take a look at the following differential equation\n$$\\frac{dv}{dt} + av + bv^3 = 0$$\nThis is unsolvable with any of the methods we have discussed so far. However it is possible to find a substitution.\nBernoulli Equation This equation is an example of a Bernoulli equation and is comprised of a y term, a y' term and some power of y, call this power n. The trick is to call $$u = y^{n-1}$$ and the equation becomes separable. In this case, call $$u = v^{-2}$$ and one gets\n$$-\\frac{du}{2dt} + au + b = 0$$\n$$\\int\\frac{du}{au+b} = \\int 2dt$$\n$$u = \\frac{1}{a}(\\exp(2a+c)-b)$$\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{\\exp(2a+c)-b}}$$\nIf we include gravity? Look up Chini equations. These have not been solved in the general case.\n","date":"October 9, 2016","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"http://example.org/posts/ode-1/","summary":"Over the centuries, many scientists have performed experiments involving the nature of falling objects.
