Trampolines are a great way to see the use of such equations in the real world. First let&amp;rsquo;s ignore how they work and consider what they do. A trampoline is a large area of fabric that remains stretched out. When someone stands on the surface, the fabric gets pulled in, so that their feet are lower than the surface was originally.</description></item><item><title>Parachutes</title><link>http://example.org/posts/ode-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2016 19:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/ode-1/</guid><description>Over the centuries, many scientists have performed experiments involving the nature of falling objects. As a result, we can make certain assumptions when thinking about people falling through the sky. Firstly, they fall directly towards the surface in more or less a straight line. Secondly, the time it takes to fall a certain distance is the same regardless of how heavy a person is. Physicists like to write mathematical relations to describe these observations.</description></item></channel></rss>
